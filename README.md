# defined-assign
Assign only defined properties from a source object to a target object

## Description
Similar to [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign), except only defined properties will be moved to the target object.  Useful for when you want to construct an object from an unknown source object (e.g. API payload) and only want to bring over properties with values.
